What is an image?

An image, digital image, or still image is a binary representation of visual information, such as drawings, pictures, graphs, logos, or individual video frames. Digital images can be saved electronically on any storage device.

What is brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue of an image?

Contrast is determined by the difference in the color and brightness of the object and other objects within the same field of view.
Brightness is an attribute of visual perception in which a source appears to be radiating or reflecting light.
Hue is the degree to which a stimulus can be described as similar to or different from stimuli that are described as red, green, blue, and yellow

What is the difference between image processing and computer vision?

In image processing, an image is "processed", that is, transformations are applied to an input image and an output image is returned. The transformations can e.g. be "smoothing", "sharpening", "contrasting" and "stretching". The transformation used depends on the context and issue to be solved.
In computer vision, an image or a video is taken as input, and the goal is to understand (including being able to infer something about it) the image and its contents. Computer vision uses image processing algorithms to solve some of its tasks.
